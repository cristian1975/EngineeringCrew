Based on the provided SQL query, we can analyze the data retrieved from the database to determine the maximum difference in salary for Data Scientists between employees residing in the US and Germany (DE). The query groups the salaries by employee residence and job title.

From the result of the query [(90734, 'DE'), (412000, 'US')], we can observe that:

*   The maximum salary for a Data Scientist residing in Germany is $90,734.
*   The maximum salary for a Data Scientist residing in the US is $412,000.

To find the difference in salaries between these two groups, we need to subtract the lower maximum salary from the higher one. In this case:

Maximum difference = Maximum salary in the US - Maximum salary in Germany
= $412,000 - $90,734
= $321,266

Therefore, the maximum difference in salary for a Data Scientist is approximately $321,266 between employees residing in the US and those in Germany.

SQL Queries:

1.  The initial SQL query used to extract data from the database is:

    ```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE') 
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

2.  To get a more detailed analysis of the data, we can use another SQL query to calculate the total number of Data Scientists for each residence and their average salary:

    ```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_employees, AVG(salary_in_usd) as avg_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE') 
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

3.  If we want to analyze the data further by including other job titles or employee residences, we can modify the initial query accordingly:

    ```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE (job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE')) 
OR (job_title = 'Software Engineer' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'UK'))
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

4.  To understand how the maximum salary and difference in salaries are distributed within each residence group, we can use a query with additional aggregations:

    ```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, AVG(salary_in_usd) as avg_salary, SUM(CASE WHEN salary_in_usd = (SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) FROM salaries WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE')) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as percentage_max_salary
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE');
```

This query will help us understand the distribution of maximum salary and how often it appears within each residence group.

Log File:

For maintaining track of all SQL queries executed, we recommend keeping a log file where each query is timestamped along with its result. This helps in auditing and tracking changes over time.


The above-mentioned analysis and SQL queries can help you gain deeper insights into the data related to salaries for Data Scientists in different employee residences."

*   Maximum salary for a Data Scientist residing in the US: $412,000

SQL Queries
------------

Below are the SQL queries used to analyze the data:

### Initial Query
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE') 
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

### Detailed Analysis
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_employees, AVG(salary_in_usd) as avg_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE') 
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

### Modified Query for Additional Job Titles or Residences
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, employee_residence 
FROM salaries 
WHERE (job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE')) 
OR (job_title = 'Software Engineer' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'UK'))
GROUP BY employee_residence;
```

### Distribution of Maximum Salary
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) as max_salary, AVG(salary_in_usd) as avg_salary, SUM(CASE WHEN salary_in_usd = (SELECT MAX(salary_in_usd) FROM salaries WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE')) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*) * 100 as percentage_max_salary
FROM salaries 
WHERE job_title = 'Data Scientist' AND employee_residence IN ('US', 'DE');
```

Recommendation
--------------

Maintain a log file to track all SQL queries executed, including timestamp and result. This helps in auditing and tracking changes over time."
