Here's the answer in a nice, formatted way:


The query that produced this result is:

```
SELECT number, COUNT(*) 
FROM (
    SELECT number FROM lotto 
    UNION ALL
    SELECT number FROM lotto_2
) AS l; 
```

This SQL statement works by first creating a temporary table with the results of both queries. The `UNION ALL` operator combines the result-set of two or more SELECT statements into a single output. It's like combining multiple lists into one big list.

The outer query then selects each number from this combined table and counts how many times it appears. This gives us the frequency of each number in the lottery draws.

[SQL: SELECT Nr.1, COUNT(Nr.1) AS freq FROM arhivaLoto GROUP BY Nr.1 UNION ALL SELECT Nr.2, COUNT(Nr.2) AS freq FROM    │
│  arhivaLoto GROUP BY Nr.2 UNION ALL SELECT Nr.3, COUNT(Nr.3) AS freq FROM arhivaLoto GROUP BY Nr.3 UNION ALL SELECT      │
│  Nr.4, COUNT(Nr.4) AS freq FROM arhivaLoto GROUP BY Nr.4 UNION ALL SELECT Nr.5, COUNT(Nr.5) AS freq FROM arhivaLoto      │
│  GROUP BY Nr.5 UNION ALL SELECT Nr.6, COUNT(Nr.6) AS freq FROM arhivaLoto GROUP BY Nr.6;] 

import pandas as pd

# Load the data from the query result into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query("""
    SELECT number, COUNT(*) 
    FROM (
        SELECT number FROM lotto 
        UNION ALL
        SELECT number FROM lotto_2
    ) AS l; """, 

# Connect to your database here, e.g., using sqlite3 or psycopg2

conn = sqlite3.connect('your_database.db'))

# Group by the 'number' column and sum the counts for each number across all columns
freq_table = df.groupby('number')['COUNT(*)'].sum().reset_index()

# Sort the table by frequency in descending order and select the top 10 numbers
top_10_numbers = freq_table.sort_values(by='COUNT(*)', ascending=False).head(10)

print(top_10_numbers)
```

This code will create a new DataFrame `freq_table` that contains the frequency of each number across all columns, and then it will sort this table by frequency in descending order to get the top 10 numbers.

Please replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file name.


Explanation:


The query result is loaded into a pandas DataFrame `df`. Then, we use the `groupby` function to group the data by the 'number' column and calculate the sum of counts for each number across all columns. The resulting table is sorted in descending order by frequency, and the top 10 numbers are selected.

Please note that you need to replace `'your_database.db'` with your actual database file name.

**Executive Summary**
=======================

### Report Analysis: Lotto Number Frequency

#### Key Findings

* The report analyzes the frequency of numbers in two lotto datasets.
* A pandas DataFrame is used to load and process the query results.
* The frequency table is sorted by frequency in descending order, revealing the top 10 numbers.
